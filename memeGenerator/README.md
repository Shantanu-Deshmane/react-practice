<!-- Libraries used in this projects -->

==> react-router-dom
    This Library is used for routing and to navigate the pages 


==> react-draggable
    --  This library is used to drag the component or element on webpage

    --  A <Draggable> element wraps an existing element and extends it with new event handlers and styles. It does not create a wrapper element in the DOM.
        Draggable items are moved using CSS Transforms. This allows items to be dragged regardless of their current positioning (relative, absolute, or static). Elements can also be moved between drags without incident.
        If the item you are dragging already has a CSS Transform applied, it will be overwritten by <Draggable>. Use an intermediate wrapper (<Draggable><span>...</span></Draggable>) in this case.


==> react-component-export-image
    --  This Library is used to convert and save the react-components into jpeg, pdf, png, etc format.
